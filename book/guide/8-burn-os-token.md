## 8. Burn OS Token

In this section, we will learn about the burning process for the Opus pool SDK. The burning process is used to destroy the minted shares and receive the underlying assets back. This process is required when the user wants to unstake the whole staked amount. You can learn more about staking [here][stake] and unstaking [here][unstake].
