### buildUnstakeTransaction

â–¸ **buildUnstakeTransaction**(`params`): `Promise`\<[`UnstakeTransactionData`](../../../interfaces/UnstakeTransactionData.md)\>

Generates unstake transaction data to withdraw from the chosen vault

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `params` | `Object` | Parameters for building the transaction |
| `params.vault` | `Hex` | A vault address |
| `params.amount` | `bigint` | An amount of ETH to unstake, denominated in wei |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`UnstakeTransactionData`](../../../interfaces/UnstakeTransactionData.md)\>

**`Remarks`**

Integrations should use their preferred wallet interface to broadcast the transaction via RPC nodes of
their choice. This method is stateless and only generates transaction bytes, leaving the signing and broadcasting up to
the code integrating the SDK
