### buildWithdrawUnstakedTransaction

â–¸ **buildWithdrawUnstakedTransaction**(`params`): `Promise`\<[`UnstakeQueueTransactionData`](../../../interfaces/UnstakeQueueTransactionData.md)\>

Generates transaction data to withdraw from the unstake queue

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `params` | `Object` | Parameters for building the transaction |
| `params.vault` | \`0x$\{string}\` | A vault address |
| `params.queueItems` | [`UnstakeQueueItem`](../../../interfaces/UnstakeQueueItem.md)[] | An array of queue items to withdraw (see `getUnstakeQueueForVault`) |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`UnstakeQueueTransactionData`](../../../interfaces/UnstakeQueueTransactionData.md)\>

A promise that resolves to a transaction data object

**`Remarks`**

Integrations should use their preferred wallet interface to broadcast the transaction via RPC nodes of
their choice. This method is stateless and only generates transaction bytes, leaving the signing and broadcasting up to
the code integrating the SDK
